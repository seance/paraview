# Paraview

A multi-screen image viewer.

Present images full-screen on a second screen, while keeping the user interface with thumbnails on your screen, hidden from the audience of the presentation. Suitable for situations where you don't want to expose the preview or names of images to the audience, e.g. to maintain suspense.
